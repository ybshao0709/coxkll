    - title: "Low-Dimensional Cox KL Integration"
      desc: >
        Functions for integrating external information (risk scores or coefficients)
      into Cox models when the number of predictors (p) is less than or
      comparable to the number of observations (n). Includes cross-validation
      for tuning parameter selection.

    - title: "High-Dimensional Cox KL Integration"
      desc: >
        Functions designed for high-dimensional data (p > n), incorporating
      external information via KL divergence alongside regularization
      (Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net). Includes cross-validation.
