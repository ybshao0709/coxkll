\arguments{
\item{z}{A matrix of covariates. Rows represent observations, and columns
represent variables.}

\item{delta}{A vector of event indicators (1 = event, 0 = censored).}

\item{time}{A vector of survival/censoring times.}

\item{group}{A vector indicating group membership for each covariate.  Used
for group penalties (not implemented in this documentation, but present in
the function signature).}

\item{K}{The number of groups.}

\item{penalty}{The type of penalty to apply.  Must be either "lasso" (for
L1 regularization) or "ridge" (for L2 regularization).}

\item{theta_tilde}{A vector representing the external risk score information.
This is \emph{crucially} different from the \code{RS} parameter in the other \code{coxkl}
functions. Here, \code{theta_tilde} is used directly in the KL divergence
calculation, \emph{not} as a pre-calculated risk score.  It's likely related
to coefficients from an external model.}

\item{eta_kl}{A \emph{single} numeric value controlling the influence of the
external risk score (\code{theta_tilde}). A higher \code{eta_kl} gives more weight
to the external information. Default is 0.}

\item{alpha}{The elastic net mixing parameter.  \code{alpha = 1} corresponds to
lasso, \code{alpha = 0} corresponds to ridge, and values between 0 and 1
represent a mixture of the two.  Default is 1 (lasso).}

\item{nlambda}{The number of lambda values to use in the regularization path.
Default is 100.  The function automatically generates a sequence of lambda
values.}

\item{lambda}{An optional user-specified sequence of lambda values.  If
provided, \code{nlambda} is ignored.  It's generally recommended to let the
function generate the lambda sequence unless you have specific requirements.}

\item{lambda.min}{The ratio of the smallest lambda value to the largest lambda
value in the automatically generated sequence.  Default is 0.001.}

\item{eps}{Convergence threshold for the coordinate descent algorithm.
Default is 0.001.}

\item{max.iter}{The maximum number of iterations for the coordinate descent
algorithm. Default is 1000.}

\item{dfmax}{Maximum number of non-zero coefficients.}

\item{gmax}{Maximum number of groups with non-zero coefficients (relevant
for group penalties, but not fully described here).}

\item{tau}{A parameter related to the penalty (specific meaning depends on
the penalty type, but not fully described here). Default is 1/3.}

\item{group.multiplier}{An optional vector of weights for each group, used
to apply different penalties to different groups (not fully described here).}

\item{warn}{Logical value indicating whether to print warnings. Default is
TRUE.}

\item{returnX}{Logical value. If TRUE, the design matrix \code{z} is included
in the returned list.}

\item{activeSet}{Logical. If TRUE, an active set strategy is used to speed up computation.}

\item{actIter}{Integer. Maximum number of iteration in active set cycling.}

\item{actNum}{Integer. Maximum number of variables added to the active set at each step.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (not used in this simplified documentation,
but potentially used by the underlying implementation).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{beta}{A matrix of coefficients.  Each \emph{column} corresponds to a
different value of \code{lambda} in the regularization path.  The number of
rows is equal to the number of covariates (number of columns in \code{z}).}
\item{lambda}{The sequence of \code{lambda} values used.}
\item{df}{The number of non-zero coefficients for each value of \code{lambda}.}
\item{iter}{The number of iterations taken for each value of \code{lambda}.}
\item{group}{The \code{group} vector provided as input.}
\item{penalty}{The penalty used}
\item{alpha}{The \code{alpha} provided as input.}
\item{X}{If \code{returnX = TRUE}, the design matrix \code{z} is returned.}
}
\description{
This function estimates the coefficients of a Cox proportional hazards model
using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for data integration in high-dimensional
settings. It incorporates an external risk score (represented by \code{theta_tilde})
and supports regularization via lasso or ridge penalties.  It is designed for
situations where the number of covariates (p) can be larger than the number
of observations (n).
